This project is a system that uses the Transformer architecture to predict the price of virtual currencies. The training data uses historical fixed candlestick data (1 minute) to estimate prices for the next 1, 5, and 10 minutes. During inference, the latest 1-minute data is used as input to predict future price changes.
